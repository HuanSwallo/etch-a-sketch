# etch-a-sketch
A project where I used my DOM manipulation skills to mimic an etch-a-sketch toy using html, css, and javascript.
# How to Use
Hover over the grid to sketch. In the modes section, there are 2 modes called rainbow and shade mode. Rainbow mode generates random colors to the grid. Shade generates shades of black grids that darkens until it turns black. If you want to click on your grids, you can use click mode where it uses the selected custom color and generates the grids by either clicking or clicking while dragging. If you want to erase your grid, you can use erase mode where it erases a selected grid. Erase can also work with click mode where you can either click on a specific grid to erase or hover the specific grid to erase. \
In the design section, you can reset the grid to the desired size from 1-100. You can change the selected color if you were to go into click mode.
